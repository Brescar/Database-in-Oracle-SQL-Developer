This is a database for a company working in agriculture made in Oracle SQL Developer. 
# Content
The code in `database_agriculture_company` creates the tables, restrictions, adds entries but also plays around with some elements like queries, synonyms, sequences etc. and the code in `database_agriculture_company_part_2` uses pl/sql blocks, cursors, exceptions, procedures, functions, packages and triggers.
## Note
Elements like table names, comments and field names are written in Romanian language. To make more sense of this consider translating.
